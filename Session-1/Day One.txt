Website
---------

There are two types of website
	1. Static Website 
	---------------------
	- Where user can't do any interaction (Wickipedia)

	2. Dynamic Website
	---------------------
	- where user can do interactions( Login, register, update profile,like,comments etc)
	- examples: facebook.com,amazon.in


Programming Language:
----------------------

A language which is sused to create a program  using that you can communicate with your computer system
or with the application.

Example: Python,JS,C#,C,C++,Java

How it is working?
------------------
- programming language means where you can not run the program directly,first we have to convert it in machine understable code and then only we can run it.

- machine understable code is called as byte code(native code) which you can execute


- to convert your program into native code you required a compiler which will compile your program into byte code

- Each Programming Language has its own Compiler.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WebApplication
---------------
- it is divided into three parts
	1. Frontend
	2. Backend
	3. Database
 (some time backend and database may be at the same location)



----------------------------------------------------------------


Front End:
	- means view(GUI Graphic User Interface OR Representation Of Your Application)
	- the things or information like Buttons, Images, that we want to show to client/User
	- we can create using HTML,CSS,JS etc...
Back End:
	- means user can't see becuase its a logic written to process  the user request

	- that we can write using the languages like: Java,c#, Python...

Database:
	-Its storage which storing all your information of application
	-examples: oracle,MySql,MS SQL Server,MA Access etc..

BASIC OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
=============================

VARIABLE:
	- whose value can be varied and not fixed everytime
	- whenever you try to work with some program you required to take input from user and process the input and generate the output
	- for that you require some temperary storage to store this input and output values. 
	- for that we can declare varibles
	- it store the value and you can process the same.

IDENTIFIER:

	- TO INDENTIFY A variable created, we require indentifier
	- we can say that name of varibale
	- to name a varibale we need to foolow some set of rules

Rules:
	1. varibale name van not start with number (1num is not valid)
	2. it can be an alphanumeric (num1 is valid)
	3. No Special characters are allowed (.,?/ space etc)
	4. Only _ and $ you can use while giving the variable name.
	5. it can not  be more than 255 character long.
	6. naming convensions: first word should be in lower case,if it contains more words then second word first letter should be in capital 
	(eg: firstName,lastName,monileNo...) Or
	(eg: first_name,last_name,mobile_no)
	7. should not give the name of variable with reserved keywords


KEYWORD:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- a specific keyword  which are basically used to write code in programming langugae.
-like if, else, switch, inlcude, int, float, boolean,double,char etc...


DataTypes:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- whenever you try to store your data , your memory must asign a memory size to that varibale so that it can store values inside the same, that you can define with the type of  your data.means your data can be a number, decimal number, text, single character, or either true or false.

1. WHOLE NUMBER(0,1,2,3,4......) : it can be zero or positive : int

2. DECIMAL NUMBER(1.2, 4.6,negative or positive or zero but with floating points): float

3. SINGLE CHARACTER('a','l') : char

4. TEXT - sequence of characters ("NIKUNJ")- Array of char

5. single bit value (0 or 1)--0-false, 1-true
