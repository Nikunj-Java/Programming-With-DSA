Programming Language:
----------------------

A language which is sused to create a program  using that you can communicate with your computer system
or with the application.

Example: Python,JS,C#,C,C++,Java

How it is working?
------------------
- programming language means where you can not run the program directly,first we have to convert it in machine understable code and then only we can run it.

- machine understable code is called as byte code(native code) which you can execute


- to convert your program into native code you required a compiler which will compile your program into byte code

- Each Programming Language has its own Compiler.
